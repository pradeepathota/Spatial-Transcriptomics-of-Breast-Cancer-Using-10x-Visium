# Spatial Transcriptomics of Breast Cancer Using 10x Visium

This project analyzes breast cancer tissue using **10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics data**. Utilized the `Scanpy` Python framework to uncover spatial gene expression patterns, identify distinct tissue regions, and annotate cell types within the tumor microenvironment.

---

## Objectives

- Preprocess and filter spatial transcriptomics data
- Identify spatially variable gene expression patterns
- Cluster tissue spots and discover tumor subregions
- Annotate clusters with biologically meaningful cell types
- Visualize spatial architecture and gene markers in tissue

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [10x Genomics Visium - Breast Cancer Block A, Section 1](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets)
- **File Used:** `filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5` (along with image and spatial metadata)

---

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Loading
Load the `.h5` expression matrix using `scanpy`.

### 2. Tissue Filtering
Keep only spots within tissue (`in_tissue == 1`) to exclude background noise.

### 3. Normalization & Log Transformation
Normalize total counts and apply log1p transformation for downstream analysis.

### 4. Highly Variable Genes
Select top 2,000 most variable genes using Seurat flavor.

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
Apply PCA to compress data while retaining variance.

### 6. Neighborhood Graph
Construct a nearest-neighbors graph for clustering.

### 7. Clustering
Use the Leiden algorithm to identify transcriptionally distinct regions.

### 8. Marker Gene Ranking
Identify top genes distinguishing each cluster using Wilcoxon test.

### 9. Cell Type Annotation
Manually map clusters to known cell types using marker genes.

### 10. Visualization
Visualize annotated cell types in spatial tissue and UMAP plots.

## Example Outputs

- **Spatial plot of clusters:** Tissue sections colored by Leiden clusters.
- **UMAP:** Visualization of clusters in reduced 2D space.
- **Cell type map:** Tumor vs immune vs stromal regions annotated.
- **Top markers:** Genes characterizing each spatial domain.
